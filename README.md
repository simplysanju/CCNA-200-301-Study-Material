# 30 days learning concept on CCNA 200-301
--- 
Below is a 30-day learning plan for preparing for the CCNA 200-301 exam (Cisco Certified Network Associate). This plan assumes you’re starting with little to no prior networking knowledge and aims to cover the key topics tested in the exam: Network Fundamentals, Network Access, IP Connectivity, IP Services, Security Fundamentals, and Automation and Programmability. Each day includes a concept to study, suggested activities, and approximate time commitments (2-3 hours/day). Adjust based on your pace and prior experience.

Activity: Practice converting binary to decimal; identify IP classes.

**Day 5**: Subnetting Part 1
Concept: Subnet masks, CIDR notation (e.g., /24), calculating subnets.
Activity: Solve 5 subnetting problems (e.g., subnet a /24 into 4 networks).

**Day 6**: Subnetting Part 2
Concept: Advanced subnetting, finding hosts per subnet, usable IPs.
Activity: Practice 10 subnetting problems with varying CIDR notations.

**Day 7**: IPv6 Basics
Concept: IPv6 format, address types (unicast, multicast, anycast), why IPv6 matters.
Activity: Compare IPv4 vs. IPv6; write out an IPv6 address example.

##  Week 2: Network Access and Switching
Goal: Understand how devices connect and communicate at Layer 2.

**Day 8**: Ethernet Basics
Concept: Ethernet frames, MAC addresses, CSMA/CD.
Activity: Study Ethernet frame structure; simulate a collision scenario.

**Day 9**: Switching Concepts
Concept: How switches work, MAC address tables, flooding, forwarding.
Activity: Watch a switching demo; explain a MAC table lookup.

**Day 10**: VLANs (Virtual LANs)
Concept: VLAN purpose, tagging (802.1Q), VLAN configuration basics.
Activity: Simulate VLAN setup using Packet Tracer (free Cisco tool).

**Day 11**: Switch Configuration
Concept: Basic Cisco IOS commands (e.g., enable, configure terminal, VLAN setup).
Activity: Practice 5-10 CLI commands in Packet Tracer.

**Day 12**: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
Concept: Prevent loops in networks, root bridge, BPDUs.
Activity: Diagram an STP topology; identify the root bridge.

**Day 13**: Wireless Fundamentals
Concept: WLAN components (APs, controllers), SSIDs, Wi-Fi standards (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax).
Activity: Research Wi-Fi channels and interference.

**Day 14**: Review and Labs
Concept: Consolidate Week 2 topics.
Activity: Build a small LAN with VLANs in Packet Tracer; troubleshoot.

## Week 3: IP Connectivity and Routing
Goal: Master Layer 3 concepts and routing.

**Day 15**: Routing Basics
Concept: Static vs. dynamic routing, routing tables, next-hop concept.
Activity: Configure a static route in Packet Tracer.

**Day 16**: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
Concept: Dynamic routing protocol, areas, LSAs, adjacency.
Activity: Set up a simple OSPF network in Packet Tracer.

**Day 17**: IP Routing Troubleshooting
Concept: Ping, traceroute, reading routing tables.
Activity: Simulate a routing issue and fix it.

**Day 18**: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
Concept: Mapping IP to MAC addresses, ARP table.
Activity: Capture ARP packets using Wireshark.

**Day 19**: NAT (Network Address Translation)
Concept: PAT, static NAT, dynamic NAT, how it saves IP addresses.
Activity: Configure NAT on a Cisco router in Packet Tracer.

**Day 20**: Default Gateway and Inter-VLAN Routing
Concept: Role of default gateway, routing between VLANs.
Activity: Set up inter-VLAN routing with a router-on-a-stick.

**Day 21**: Review and Labs
Concept: Reinforce routing concepts.
Activity: Build a multi-router network with OSPF and NAT.

# Week 4: IP Services, Security, and Automation
Goal: Cover services, security, and modern networking trends.

**Day 22**: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Concept: DHCP process (DORA), configuring a DHCP server.
Activity: Set up DHCP on a Cisco device.

**Day 23**: DNS (Domain Name System)
Concept: DNS hierarchy, resolving names to IPs.
Activity: Use nslookup or dig to query DNS records.

**Day 24**: Security Fundamentals
Concept: Threats (e.g., DoS), ACLs (Access Control Lists), best practices.
Activity: Configure a standard ACL in Packet Tracer.

**Day 25**: VPNs and Wireless Security

## Tips for Success
- Resources: Use Cisco’s official CCNA 200-301 study guide, Packet Tracer (free), and online platforms like CBT Nuggets, Udemy, or INE.
- Practice: Spend extra time on labs—hands-on experience is key.
- Subnetting: Master this early—it’s critical for the exam.
- Schedule: Stick to 2-3 hours daily; take breaks to avoid burnout.
- Exam Registration: Book your exam (via Pearson VUE) by Day 25 to stay motivated.
